Step 0: Setting up the Project
Install Anaconda: Download and install the Anaconda distribution from the official website for your operating system from here.

Create a new project folder. Let’s name it “dino”. Open VS Code in this folder and open terminal.

Create a new conda environment: Open Anaconda Prompt or your terminal and create a new conda environment by running the following command
'''
conda create --name myenv python=3.10
'''
This will create a new environment named myenv with Python 3.10 installed.

Activate the environment: Once the environment is created, activate it using the following command:
```
conda activate myenv
```
Install PyTorch: Install the PyTorch library with CUDA support (for GPU acceleration) using the following command:
```
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c conda-forge
```
This command installs PyTorch, TorchVision, and TorchAudio with the CUDA toolkit version 11.1. You can change the version of the CUDA toolkit as per your requirement.

Test the installation: To verify the PyTorch installation, run the following command to start a Python interpreter in your conda environment:

python
Then, import the PyTorch library and print its version as follows:

import torch
print(torch.__version__)
This should print the version number of PyTorch installed in your environment.
